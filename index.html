  <h1>Tom Evans</h1>
  <p class="muted">Tom Evans is a geographer who conducts research on global environmental change 
with an emphasis on climate adaptation, land use, and the interaction between 
human and natural systems. Most of his collaborations involve some combination of household survey research, computational simulation, institutional analysis and spatial analysis (GIS and remote sensing). But an over-arching thread has been the search for new and novel ways to integrate social and environmental data to investigate complex systems.

    
  
  He started his academic career at Indiana University in the Department of Geography with affiliations to multiple campus research centers including the Vincent and Elinor Ostrom Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis. 
    In 2018 he moved to the University of Arizona to join the faculty of the School of Geography, Development and Environment. 
    In 2021 he took a leave of absence from U Arizona to serve as a Program Director at the United States National Science Foundation in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences and moved to a permanent Program Director position at NSF in 2023.

Through his career he has built multi-disciplinary research teams and collaborations that span environmental and social science domains. Geographically he has conducted work in the US, South America, Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa with particular emphasis on land-use and agricultural decision-making.
